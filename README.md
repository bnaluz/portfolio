README 
Portfolio project to showcase skills with Next.js, React/TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. 
The site was used as an opportunity to practice Next.js built in lazy loading Image and routing, practice styling with TailwindCSS, and create a contact form at the bottom. 

Each project has its own page where you will find a short description of the project, access to the code (if possble) and access to the live site. 

Send me an email from the contact form on the site when you make it there :) 

Deployed on Vercel.
